A mirai-client implemented in Rust.

-------------

## Usage

Add following code in your `Cargo.toml`.

The newest version is: `0.1.0`.

mirai_rs is still unstable, so I recommend you use the newest version that avoid some bugs ~~(and get more new bugs)~~.

```toml
mirai_rs = "<the version which you need>"
```
